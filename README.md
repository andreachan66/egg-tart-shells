this collection is filled with egg tart shells - 30 shells per pack
each package contains 30 shells,  as soon as a package is open, please keep it frozen in the freezer , NEVER keep egg tart shells in the fridge, else it would go modding and rotten in 2 days.

how to use egg tart shells:
open the package, and separate the shells and put them into a baking pane, and pull in the egg tart batter into each of the shell
pre-heat the oven to 359 degrees celsius, and bake the egg tart shells for 20 minutes, and turn on the oven lights and observe the progress of the shells being baked.  as soon as the surface area of egg tart shells are solidified, then turn off the oven heat, and keep the oven door closed, and then keep the egg tart warmed for additional 30 minutes. then the shells are done =)
